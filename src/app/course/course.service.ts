        In this tutorial, we will use the Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript or TypeScript codebase. 
        
        Expo is the easiest and fastest way to build React Native apps. The official Expo get started guide contains detailed instructions on how to download and configure Expo CLI for the major operating systems.
        
        Create a new project
        1

        1
            
        cd LoginLayout
